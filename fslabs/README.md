# FSLabs A32x

- Currently FSUIPC registered version is needed.
- FSLabsA32x.lua must be copied to FSUIPC install directory
- Current versions supports all buttons and leds, but no display
- FSLabs does not provide display information, but with defined starting values maybe something can be achieved.
